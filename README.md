# Infinite Realms

Infinite Realms is a 2D platformer protoype game which incorporates 3 distinct forms of generative AI. Made using Godot 4 and C#.

1. Image Generation
Within the game we used StableDiffusion to generate level backgrounds, character sprites and game objects. 

2. Sound Generation
The music was generated by using ... and the sound effects were generated using ... .

3. Text Generation
We used LLM's for NPC interaction.

Below each aspect is explained in further detail and what exactly is generated within the game.

## Level Design

### First Idea
Our initial idea was based on a video from Game Industry Conference, [How to generate Pixel Perfect 2D levels in Godot 4 with the help of Generative AI - Mat Rowlands](https://youtu.be/1Gw1v1sueFo). 
This video showed how you could create a platformer level using stablediffusion and controlnet. 
The first step is that you build a platform level in godot using a tilemap (preferably a tilemap with a high contrast, so a white tilemap on a black background). Once the level was created using some code it was exported as a png image. One level we created looked like this: ![LevelTemplate](./infinite-realms/templates/template-LevelCreator.png)

Now we can generate a level image using StableDiffusion and ControlNet. 

For specific explanation it is best to watch the video. But it boils down to using txt2img with the generated template in controlnet. All you need to do is think of a theme for your level and hit generate. It ussually takes quite some generation and som tweaking of the settings to get a nice image. Some example levels that we generated are shown below. (these generated using 2 different templates)
![Level1ViaTemplate](./infinite-realms/Assets/LevelBackgrounds/Level1.png)
![Level2ViaTemplate](./infinite-realms/Assets/LevelBackgrounds/Level2.png)
![Level1.2ViaTemplate](./infinite-realms/Assets/LevelBackgrounds/00025-2195908195.png)
![Level1.3ViaTemplate](./infinite-realms/Assets/LevelBackgrounds/00161-3136522623.png)

In the end we did not choose to use this way of generating the levels. As you can see in the levels above there are some visual artifacts and they are a bit bland. It was very hard to create a level with objects in the background. Thus leading to little depth in the image. So we changed gears.

Name exact models used etc.

### Second Idea
We wanted more detail and depth for our levels. So instead of generating an image around the level we turned it around and designed the level after generating an image. We came across a very cool pixel like SD2.1 model named [PIXHELL](https://civitai.com/models/21276/pixhell). The game is played with a resolution of 1920x1080
